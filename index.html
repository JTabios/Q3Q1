                  I have watched this version 7 times and loving it more each time I watch this version.

                  The choice of casts is genius. 
                  The acting abilities from all the actors to bring this script to life is incredible. 
                  The special effects is beyond imagination. Thousand times loving it!
                  The storyline is so well put, well written and so believable.

                  If you are looking for child-friendly, goofy type of movie then the first 4 Mummy versions are your option. Tom Cruise's version is more intense, greater action, and yes a bit scary and that is why it is so captivating interesting and it allows me to watch this movie over and over again and not be bored to death over it.</td>

                        New flash people!!! You can easily change it to 'original french audio' in Netflix's settings and then use English subtitles! That's how I watched it because I wanted to hear the actor's real voices instead of it being dubbed and it was much better. It is a great show and Omar Sy is an amazing actor. I sat through the whole 5 episodes in one night and was amazed at how into it I was. Great job with the show. However, like the other reviewers, I agree, he is so smart how did he not think to put the darn VHS tape in himself to make sure it was the real one! Lupin is a good, clean mystery that you can watch even with the kiddos roaming around. Can't wait for the 2nd part!!!</td>

              <td>Barely 17 yet, Frank is a skilled forger who has passed as a doctor, lawyer and pilot. FBI agent Carl becomes obsessed with tracking down the con man, who only revels in the pursuit.</td>
              <td>Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, Amy Adams, and James Brolin in supporting roles.</td>
              <td><br><br>"Catch Me If You Can" takes us on a thrilling ride, it is like a Tom and Jerry chase, but with a real-life twist featuring the charming con artist Frank Abagnale. While I'm a devoted fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I'll do my best to provide an unbiased review.

              This film seamlessly weaves together a captivating narrative, humor, and the reliable presence of Tom Hanks. It's a rollercoaster of emotions and suspense that keeps you hooked from start to finish. 

              When it comes to acting, rest assured, there's no room for doubt. DiCaprio and Hanks shine brilliantly in their respective roles.

              In summary, "Catch Me If You Can" is a must-see, especially for fans of both Tom and Leo.</td>
